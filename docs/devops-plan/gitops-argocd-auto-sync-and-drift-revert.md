# Stage 7 — GitOps (ArgoCD)

**Date:** 2026-07-26/27
**Repo the actual manifests live in:** `Animal-Shelter-Workshop` (`k8s/`,
already existed from Stage 5) — this write-up lives in the homelab meta-repo
instead, alongside the devops practice plan it's a stage of
(`devops-practice-plan.md`, Stage 7's checklist, all 4 items).

## Why I built this

Every stage up to this point still relied on a human (or a CI job) to push
changes into the cluster directly — `kubectl apply`, `helm install`, a
Terraform run. Nothing was watching to make sure the cluster actually stayed
in the state git said it should be in. Stage 7 closes that gap: git becomes
the one source of truth, ArgoCD becomes the thing that enforces it — both on
the way in (a git change lands in the cluster on its own) and on the way out
(a manual change straight to the cluster gets silently undone). This also
depends on Stage 5's k3s cluster existing already, since ArgoCD installs
*inside* it, not alongside it.

## What I built

### 0. Capacity re-check + headroom for ArgoCD on `linux-k3s`

`free -h` on `proxmox` at the start of this session: 269Mi free, 4.4Gi
available, swap already at 5.4Gi/7.6Gi (up from 2.2Gi at the start of Stage
6 — the trend the Stage 6 handoff flagged as worth watching). Inside the
`linux-k3s` CT itself: only 1.5GB total, 781Mi available — not enough
headroom for ArgoCD's ~1-2GB ask on its own.

Bumped the CT's own allocation live, no restart needed (LXC memory is a
cgroup limit, not a boot-time setting):

```
pct set 100 --memory 3072 --swap 768
```

confirmed inside the CT immediately (`free -h` showed 3.0Gi total before
ArgoCD was even installed). Host-side `proxmox` stayed steady afterward
(541Mi free / 3.8Gi available, swap ticked up slightly to 5.6Gi) — the
whole install fit without pushing the host past where it already was.

### 1. ArgoCD installed into the k3s cluster

Official stable manifests, not Helm (kept it to plain `kubectl`, consistent
with how the rest of the cluster was built by hand in Stage 5):

```
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

Hit one real snag: `applicationsets.argoproj.io`'s CRD is large enough that
a plain `kubectl apply` fails —
`metadata.annotations: Too long: may not be more than 262144 bytes`,
because `kubectl apply` stores the whole previous manifest in a
`last-applied-configuration` annotation and this CRD alone blows past the
256KB cap. Every other object in the install applied fine; only this one
CRD failed, repeatedly, on a second `apply` too. Fixed by switching to
server-side apply, which tracks field ownership instead of stuffing the
whole config into an annotation:

```
kubectl apply -n argocd -f <same URL> --server-side --force-conflicts
```

All 7 ArgoCD components (`application-controller`, `applicationset-controller`,
`dex-server`, `notifications-controller`, `redis`, `repo-server`, `server`)
came up `1/1 Running` within about a minute. One transient
`CreateContainerConfigError` on `argocd-server` (`secret "argocd-redis" not
found`) self-resolved on kubelet's own retry once the secret finished being
created — no manual fix needed.

**Also needed:** the k3s CT's own kubeconfig
(`/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml`) is root-only by default, and k3s's bundled
`kubectl` (a symlink to the `k3s` binary) ignores the usual
`~/.kube/config` convention unless `KUBECONFIG` is explicitly set — it
falls back to `/etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` regardless. Copied the file to
the SSH user's own `~/.kube/config` and exported `KUBECONFIG` in
`~/.bashrc`/`~/.profile` for future sessions, so `kubectl` works
passwordless going forward without `sudo` every time.

**Web GUI:** ArgoCD ships its own — `argocd-server` was `ClusterIP`-only by
default, so nothing outside the cluster could reach it. Patched it to
`NodePort` (same pattern as the app's own `Service` from Stage 5, which
already uses NodePort `30080`):

```
kubectl -n argocd patch svc argocd-server --patch-file argocd-server-patch.yaml
# port 443 -> nodePort 30943
```

Now reachable at `https://linux-k3s.taufiq.lab:30943` (self-signed cert,
browser will warn once) — `admin` / the auto-generated password from
`argocd-initial-admin-secret` in the `argocd` namespace.

### 2. Pointed at `Animal-Shelter-Workshop`'s own repo

Stage 5's manifests already live in that repo's `k8s/` directory — no new
repo needed, matching the plan's own instruction. One real blocker first:
`Animal-Shelter-Workshop` was **3 commits ahead of `origin/main`** (Stage 4
Docker, Stage 5 k8s manifests, Stage 6 observability — all local-only per
this project's own convention of not pushing until asked). Origin had no
`k8s/` directory at all yet. Pushed all 3 (`48c918e`) — confirmed with the
user first, since it also triggers the real `Tests` → `Deploy` GitHub
Actions pipeline against production, not just a local git operation.

Confirmed the repo is public (`gh repo view` / GitHub API,
`"private": false`) — ArgoCD pulls over plain HTTPS, no deploy key or PAT
needed.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: animal-shelter-workshop
  namespace: argocd
spec:
  project: default
  source:
    repoURL: https://github.com/tttaufiqqq/Animal-Shelter-Workshop.git
    targetRevision: main
    path: k8s
  destination:
    server: https://kubernetes.default.svc
    namespace: default
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
```

`kubectl apply -f` this and ArgoCD adopted Stage 5's existing `Deployment`
cleanly — same Pods, same age, no restart — immediately reporting
`Synced` / `Healthy`.

### 3. Git-driven change → auto-sync

Bumped `asw-app` from 2 to 3 replicas in `k8s/deployment.yaml`, committed
and pushed (`cd53331`). Forced an immediate refresh rather than waiting for
ArgoCD's default ~3-minute poll:

```
kubectl -n argocd annotate application animal-shelter-workshop \
  argocd.argoproj.io/refresh=hard --overwrite
```

Confirmed synced within seconds — `Deployment` back to `replicas: 3`, a
third Pod (`asw-app-...-4kmtw`) came up `2/2 Running`, the original two
Pods untouched.

### 4. Manual cluster change → drift detected and reverted

```
kubectl patch deployment asw-app -p '{"spec":{"replicas":5}}'
```

`selfHeal: true` caught this before it was even worth re-checking by
hand — `kubectl get deploy asw-app` already read back `3` moments later.
Confirmed it was a real detect-and-revert, not just no-op luck, via
`kubectl -n argocd get events --sort-by='.lastTimestamp'`:

```
Updated sync status: Synced -> OutOfSync
Initiated automated sync to 'cd533317fdf8b18a9171fe2846d9f4e5e6f28589'
Partial sync operation to cd533317fdf8b18a9171fe2846d9f4e5e6f28589 succeeded
Updated sync status: OutOfSync -> Synced
```

The event log names the exact commit it reverted back to — the same one
git already had, not a stale or different state.

## How to independently verify each item

| # | Command | Expected |
|---|---------|----------|
| 1 | `kubectl -n argocd get pods` | all 7 components `1/1 Running` |
| 2 | `kubectl -n argocd get application animal-shelter-workshop` | `SYNC STATUS: Synced`, `HEALTH STATUS: Healthy` |
| 3 | edit `k8s/deployment.yaml`, push, `kubectl -n argocd annotate application animal-shelter-workshop argocd.argoproj.io/refresh=hard --overwrite` | cluster state matches the new git value within seconds |
| 4 | `kubectl patch deployment asw-app -p '{"spec":{"replicas":<anything else>}}'`, then re-check | reverts back to git's value on its own, no manual fix |

## What carries forward to Stage 8 — and what doesn't

- The `Application` resource, the `argocd` namespace, and the NodePort GUI
  all stay live and running — Stage 8 (Public Cloud) has no dependency on
  any of it, since that stage runs on Azure, not this k3s node.
- This is genuinely the last stage that touches `linux-k3s` directly in
  this plan — worth another `free -h`/`swapon --show` pass before adding
  anything else to that CT in the future, since it's now carrying k3s +
  the app + Vault injector + all of ArgoCD on 3GB.

## Screenshots

![ArgoCD Applications view — animal-shelter-workshop, Project default, Status Healthy/Synced, Repository https://github.com/tttaufiqqq/Animal-Shelter-Workshop, Target Revision main, Path k8s, Destination in-cluster, Namespace default, Created 07/26/2026 23:59:22, Last Sync 07/27/2026 00:01:34](images/stage7-argocd-application-synced-healthy.png)

The ArgoCD UI itself (`https://linux-k3s.taufiq.lab:30943`), confirming
everything verified via `kubectl` above holds up in the GUI too: the
`animal-shelter-workshop` `Application` card, `Healthy`/`Synced`, pointed
at the right repo/branch/path, `Last Sync` timestamp matching the
drift-revert test from section 4.

![ArgoCD Application Details Tree for animal-shelter-workshop — APP HEALTH Healthy, SYNC STATUS Synced to main (cd53331), LAST SYNC Sync OK to cd53331 succeeded 29 minutes ago, author tttaufiqqq, comment "feat(k8s): Stage 7 GitOps sync test - bump asw-app to 3 replicas". Sync status counts in the left sidebar: 5 Synced, 0 OutOfSync, 7 Healthy. Full resource tree, expanded to Pod level: animal-shelter-workshop fans out to asw-app-config (cm), asw-nginx-config (cm), asw-app-secret (secret), asw-app (svc), and asw-app (deploy, rev:2) — the Deployment fans out to two ReplicaSets, asw-app-c7857ccf8 (rev:2, current) and asw-app-794dcdd558 (rev:1, old, 0 pods); the current ReplicaSet fans out to all 3 live Pods (asw-app-c7857ccf8-4kmtw, -8h7t5, -569rj), each 2/2 running — the exact 3 Pods from the replica-bump test in section 3, all green](images/stage7-argocd-application-resource-tree.png)

The `Application` detail resource-tree view, expanded all the way down to
individual Pods — every managed object (`ConfigMap`s, `Secret`, `Service`,
`Deployment`, both `ReplicaSet` revisions, and all 3 live `Pod`s from the
replica-bump in section 3) shown individually, each green, confirming
ArgoCD is tracking the full object graph down to the Pod level, not just
reporting an aggregate status. The sidebar's own counts (5 Synced / 0
OutOfSync, 7 Healthy) corroborate the same picture. `LAST SYNC` here
matches the same `cd53331` commit and timestamp as the card view above.

Still worth adding next session:
- The sync history / timeline view showing the auto-sync and self-heal
  events from sections 3 and 4 above.

## Where things live

- **ArgoCD itself:** `argocd` namespace inside the `linux-k3s` CT (100),
  same cluster as Stage 5.
- **The `Application` resource + Service patch YAML:** applied directly via
  `kubectl`, not committed anywhere — they describe ArgoCD's own
  configuration, not app code. Worth committing to
  `Animal-Shelter-Workshop`'s `k8s/` directory in a future session
  (`k8s/argocd-application.yaml`) so ArgoCD's own config is itself
  git-tracked, the same principle this whole stage is about.
- **The actual manifests ArgoCD watches:** `Animal-Shelter-Workshop`'s own
  `k8s/` directory (`deployment.yaml`, `service.yaml`,
  `nginx-configmap.yaml`, `app-configmap.yaml`, `app-secret.yaml`) — same
  files Stage 5 created, `main` branch, public repo.

## Credentials created this session (not in git — keep track here)

- **ArgoCD admin password:** `XLf9bvMnYcDLmqjx` — ArgoCD's own
  auto-generated `argocd-initial-admin-secret` (namespace `argocd`), not
  chosen. Worth rotating via the UI once logged in once, same general
  practice as any other freshly-installed admin credential in this
  homelab.
